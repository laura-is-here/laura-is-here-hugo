## my experiences with two mainstays in the world of static sites

as a primarily self-taught designer and developer, discovering static site generators marked a breakthrough in my web development skills and, more importantly, work flow and build process.

i cut my teeth on html and css in plain text files uploaded straight to the server. the first iteration of this site was actually hosted on {{< anchor "neocities" "https://neocities.org" >}} and was, in fact, primarily edited in their in-browser editor!

it wasn't until the folks with {{< anchor "Long Beach Anarchist Collective" "https://anarchistlb.org" >}} requested an events page that i started delving more into content management systems and, {{< anchor "after ruling out wordpress as bulky and unnecessary" "https://gettingthingstech.com/hugo-vs.-wordpress-page-load-speed-comparison-hugo-leaves-wordpress-in-its-dust/" >}}, discovered {{< anchor "Jekyll" "https://jekyllrb.com" >}}.

## Jekyll

jekyll was initially appealing to me due to its home in the realm of {{< anchor "ruby" "https://ruby-lang.org/" >}}, a language and environment with which i was already somewhat familiar.

jekyll presented several immediate advantages to my work flow and build process:

* live rendering of the site on a local server
* the ability to use "includes" to easily recycle components like menus, headers, etc.
* integration with sass/SCSS
