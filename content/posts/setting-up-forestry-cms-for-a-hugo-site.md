one of the only things i've missed from working on maintaining wordpress sites is the easy configurability&mdash;log in to the dashboard and you'll have access to edit a number of elements through easy WYSIWYG editors.

a properly configured wordpress site and theme allows easy access and control to some of the most prominent items of a site, such as title, what sections appear on what pages, as well as longer form content.
